To expose services to the external world we have two options -

LoadBalancer - It is a service type that exposes the application in an external load balancer it distributes the requests among multiple backend services.

It is a service that points to external load balancers that are not in your Kubernetes cluster but exist elsewhere outside the cluster

This service has limitations lets say we have 10 websites hosted in your cluster and you want to expose them all to external traffic.
If you use type LoadBalancer Service you have to expose all 10 services on Cloud load balancers (each service costs money)

Service provides a load-balancing mechanism but it is a simple Round-robin load-balancing algorithm It evenly distributes incoming traffic across the available pods behind the Service.

The default load-balancing algorithm is simple and effective in many cases, it may not provide advanced features such as ratio-based traffic distribution, sticky sessions, whitelisting, blacklisting, or other more advanced load-balancing strategies.

To overcome these limitations, Kubernetes provides options to integrate with more advanced load-balancing components like Ingress

2. Igress - In Kubernetes, an Ingress is the same as a load balancer service but it has some more features which are not available in load balancer. Ingress is a separate API object in Kubernetes which is not part of the Kubernetes Service resource. Ingress solves the limitation of the LoadBalancer service.

Lets say we have 10 websites hosted in your cluster and you want to expose them all to external traffic. If you use type LoadBalancer Service you have to expose all 10 services on Cloud load balancers (each service costs money) but In ingress, you just need to expose one service and it'll point to an Ingress Controller running in your cluster.

exposing multiple services to the external world using a single public IP address which is cost-effective when applications run in cloud infrastructure like AWS.

What is Ingress?

It is an object that allows traffic to come into the Kubernetes cluster. Ingress acts as a traffic controller or entry point to your cluster, allowing external traffic to reach the services running within it. The external traffic could be via HTTP or HTTPS to a service running within your Kubernetes cluster.

Internet -> Ingress -> K8s Services -> Replicas

How to setup ingress

It is a two-step process

First, we need to create an Ingress controller

Configure the Ingress resource

Ingress Controller - Ingress controller is the same as the load balancer but it has also an API gateway, Kubernetes has different types of ingress controllers to manage the resources like

NGINX ingress controller

F5

Istio

HAproxy etc.

Ingress controller is responsible for implementing the Ingress rules and handling incoming traffic. Ingress controller is not part of the control plane component we need to deploy this separately in the cluster

Set-Up Ingress controller -

Minikube v0.14.0 (and above) ships with Nginx ingress setup as an add-on . It can be easily enabled by executing

minikube addons enable ingress

with these simple step ingress controller is enabled

To check ingress controller is installed or not run pod command because ingress controller is pod

kubectl get pods -A | grep nginx

as you can see that it is running in the ingress-nginx namespace

Ingress resource - Once you successfully created Ingress controller then we can proceed with creating an Ingress resource.Ingress resources are a set of rules that define how incoming traffic should be directed to backend services. These rules can define by

1- Path-based

2- Hostname-based routing

Path-base routing - Path-based routing in Kubernetes Ingress allows you to route incoming requests to different backend services based on the URL path.

Let's say we have example.com and have two backend services running in your Kubernetes cluster: Service A and Service B. You want to route incoming requests based on the URL path to these services.

Service A handles requests for the "/app" path.

Service B handles requests for the "/api" path.

    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: example-ingress
    spec:
      rules:
        - http:
            paths:
              - path: /app
                pathType: Prefix
                backend:
                  service:
                    name: service-a
                    port:
                      number: 80
              - path: /api
                pathType: Prefix
                backend:
                  service:
                    name: service-b
                    port:
                      number: 80

In this example, the Ingress resource defines two rules using the paths field:

Requests with the path "/app" will be forwarded to Service A.

Requests with the path "/api" will be forwarded to Service B.

Host-based routing - Host-based routing in Kubernetes Ingress allows you to route incoming requests to different backend services based on the requested hostname.

It's like having different addresses for different services within a single cluster.

Let's say you have two backend services, Service A and Service B, and you want to direct requests based on the requested hostname:

Requests with the hostname "app.example.com" should go to Service A.

Requests with the hostname "api.example.com" should go to Service B.

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: app.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            backend:
              service:
                name: service-a
                port:
                  number: 80
    - host: api.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            backend:
              service:
                name: service-b
                port:
                  number: 80

In this example, the Ingress resource has two rules specified under rules:

Requests with the hostname "app.example.com" will be directed to Service A.

Requests with the hostname "api.example.com" will be directed to Service B.

How to create ingress resource

To create an ingress resource first you need to Create a YAML file that defines your Ingress resource rules.

save this yaml file as ingress.yaml

Apply the Ingress resource to your Kubernetes cluster by

kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml

You can check whether ingress resources are created or not by

kubectl get ingress

ingress resource is created

How to deploy applications using Ingress

Requirements

Kubectl configured

minikube installed

Kubernetes cluster running

Docker image

Strat the minikube cluster by minikube start command.

Deploy and Enable the Ingress controller

To enable the NGINX Ingress controller, run the following command minikube addons enable ingress

to verify ingress controller is running or not use this command

kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx

Deploy application in our cluster I am again using my own portfolio. The Docker image needs to be pulled. you can use any image of your choice.

First, i am creating deployment and service file deployment.yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-portfolio
  labels:
    app: my-portfolio
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-portfolio
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-portfolio
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: portfolio
        image: hemantsw/portfolio
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-portfolio-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: my-portfolio 
  ports:
    - name: my-portfolio
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80

Now apply this file by kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml (replace deployment with your yaml file name)

deployment and service are created parallely you can verify it by running kubectl get deployment and kubectl get svc commands

As you can see that both are running

In a few seconds, the image should be pulled & the pod should be running.

To check pods are running use this command kubectl get pods -o wide

Now, we will create an Ingress resource that will enable us to access the application.

First we need to create ingress.yaml file

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-portfolio-ingress
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
    - host: hemantsw.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-portfolio-service
                port:
                  number: 80

In this yaml file I have set host as hemantsw.com means i can access the application with this DNS name

Now apply the yaml file by kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml

Letâ€™s check the ingress now by kubectl get ingress command

So, when i enter http://hemantsw.com in my browser, I will not able to access the web application because -

our browser doesnâ€™t know/understand hemantsw.com address. because this domain doesnâ€™t exist. So, we can edit your /etc/hosts file.

To edit /etc/hosts run this command sudo vim /etc/hosts

It will ask for password just enter the pass word and Append 127.0.0.1 hemantsw.com to your /etc/hosts file on MacOS (NOTE: Do NOT use the Minikube IP)

Save this file

Run minikube tunnel ( Keep the window open. After you entered the password there will be no more messages, and the cursor just blinks)

Hit the http://hemantsw.com ( or whatever host you configured in the yaml file) in a browser and it should work

Done ðŸŽ‰
